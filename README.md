# ENGR 1ML - Winter 2025 🧠💻  
Team: LA Hackeronie 🎭✨  

## Overview 📌  
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on training a neural network on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. 🏋️‍♂️🖥️  
The project includes:  
✅ Data loading 📊  
✅ Visualization 🖼️  
✅ Model training 🤖  
✅ Performance evaluation 📈  

## Features 🔥  
- 🏗️ Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset  
- 🖼️ Displays sample images from the dataset  
- 🧠 Defines a simple feedforward neural network using PyTorch  
- ⚡ Trains the model using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropy loss  
- 📊 Evaluates the model’s performance  

## Installation 🛠️  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bassiarmaan/ENGR-1ML-FINAL.git
cd ENGR-1ML-FINAL
```

Install dependencies:
```pip install torch torchvision matplotlib```

## Usage 🚀
Run the training script in the jupyter notebook `image_classifier.ipynb`


## Repository Structure 🗂️
- `model.py`: Contains the neural network architecture used in this model
- `util.py`: Contains utility functions used in the model (e.g training loop, function to show images etc)

## Results 🎯
Sample MNIST images are displayed before training, and training progress is printed to the console.
